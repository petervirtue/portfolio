# petervirtue.com

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website, [petervirtue.com](https://petervirtue.com). The goal of this project was to create a simple landing page to showcase my current & previous work, as well as where I can be found on different platforms. Built with Next.js and TypeScript, it's designed to be fast, responsive, and accessible.
*I'm hoping that with some more time soon I can continue to build out this portfolio to contain some fancier interfaces and interactions*
